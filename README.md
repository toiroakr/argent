# 🛡️ argent

**Assess the risk of an npm package _before_ you install it.**

`argent` aggregates supply-chain risk signals from multiple sources into a
single, normalized report so you can make an informed call before adding a
dependency.

> **Why "argent"?** _Argent_ is the heraldic/French word for **silver**. In
> European courts, and among Japanese shōguns and daimyō from the Sengoku
> through the Edo period, silver tableware and chopsticks were used to test
> food for poison before eating — sometimes alongside a dedicated taster
> (_dokumi-yaku_). `argent` is that silver spoon for your dependencies:
> check a package for "poison" *before* you ingest it.

Results are normalized to a shared scale — `low` · `medium` · `high` ·
`critical` · `unknown` — and the report's overall level is the worst across all
sources that returned data.

### Build-vs-Buy (adoption aid)

Beyond "is it risky", `argent` also asks **"should you even take this
dependency?"** A tiny, mundane package is often cheaper to reimplement (these
days, with AI) than to carry — every dependency is supply-chain surface area.
The `Build-vs-Buy` signal combines:

- **Size & self-containment** — unpacked size and file count (npm registry) plus
  the resolved transitive dependency count (deps.dev).
- **Domain sensitivity** — whether the package looks like crypto / auth / jwt /
  sanitization / randomness etc. Rolling your own (or AI-generating) those is a
  bad idea no matter how small, so they always lean **KEEP**.

It produces a verdict — **REIMPLEMENT? · CONSIDER · KEEP** — e.g. `is-odd`
(6 KB, trivial) → REIMPLEMENT?, `jsonwebtoken` (security-sensitive) → KEEP,
`express` (large graph) → KEEP. This is an **adoption axis, not a security
severity**, so it is shown separately and never raises the security `overall`
level.

## Two ways to use it

### CLI

> ℹ️ Published as the scoped package **`@toiroakr/argent`** (the bare `argent`
> name on npm belongs to an unrelated project). The installed command is still
> `argent`.

```bash
# one-off, no install
npx @toiroakr/argent express

# or install the `argent` command globally
npm i -g @toiroakr/argent
argent express

# pin a version, check several at once
npx @toiroakr/argent left-pad@1.3.0 lodash @sindresorhus/is

# CI gate: non-zero exit when risk >= high
npx @toiroakr/argent chalk --fail-on high

# machine-readable
npx @toiroakr/argent express --json

# enable socket.dev
SOCKET_API_KEY=sk_... npx @toiroakr/argent express
```

Options: `--json`, `--fail-on <low|medium|high|critical>`,
`--socket-key <token>`, `-h/--help`.

#### Dependency audit — "which deps should I drop?"

Point `argent` at a package and it walks its whole resolved dependency graph
(via deps.dev) and ranks every dependency by a **drop score**: how worthwhile it
is to escape that dependency to improve the package's supply-chain posture.

```bash
argent audit                       # audit the nearest package.json (deps + devDeps)
argent audit --prod                # ...skipping devDependencies
argent audit express               # audit a published package's full graph
argent audit webpack --top 30      # show the top 30 candidates
argent audit lodash --direct       # only direct dependencies (published-package mode)
argent audit express --json        # machine-readable ranking
```

With **no package argument**, `argent audit` finds the nearest `package.json`
(walking up from the current directory) and audits its dependencies, resolving
each to the registry's latest. With a package name, it audits that published
package's full resolved dependency graph.

```
  drop  package                     size↓   risk    action       why
    82  some-lib@1.2.3              1.6MB+  high(1)  reimplement  1 advisory(ies), high severity; pulls 43 dep(s), ~1.6MB+ installed
    45  bytes@3.1.2 ·              12KB    clean    reimplement  tiny, likely reimplementable
     2  jwa@2.0.1 ·               422KB   clean    keep         security-sensitive — hard to drop safely
```

`dropScore = risk × removability` — so the top of the list is **risky _and_
realistic to drop** (the most actionable). A dependency with an open advisory and
a tiny, mundane footprint scores highest; a large or security-sensitive one
(crypto, auth, …) scores low because reimplementing it is a bad idea. `·` marks
a transitive (indirect) dependency.

The **`size↓`** column is the install footprint **including the dependency's own
subtree** — i.e. the weight you'd actually shed by dropping it (a `+` means some
sub-package sizes were unknown, so it's a floor). A tiny wrapper that drags in a
large tree (e.g. `body-parser` ≈ 39 KB on its own but ≈ 1.6 MB with deps) is far
more worth escaping than its own size suggests.

audit options: `--top <n>` (default 25), `--direct`, `--prod` (skip
devDependencies), `--max <n>` (default 250), `--json`.

### Web (GitHub Pages)

A static, browser-only form: <https://toiroakr.github.io/argent/>

It runs the CORS-safe sources (deps.dev + OpenSSF Scorecard) directly in your
browser — no backend, nothing logged. Deep-link a package with
`?pkg=express`. socket.dev and Snyk Advisor are linked out since they can't be
called safely from the browser.

## Repository layout

```
packages/core   @argent/core       — provider logic + normalization (private, bundled into the CLI)
packages/cli    @toiroakr/argent   — the CLI (the package published to npm)
apps/web        @argent/web        — the GitHub Pages form (Vite)
```

The CLI and the web app share the exact same evaluation logic in
`@argent/core`; each provider declares whether it is `browserSafe`, and the web
build simply skips the ones that aren't.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test         # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build        # build core + cli
pnpm dev:web      # run the web app locally (Vite dev server)
pnpm build:web    # build the static site into apps/web/dist
```

Run the CLI from source:

```bash
pnpm cli express --json
```

## How the score is derived

- Provider scores are normalized to **0–100, higher = safer**.
  - OpenSSF Scorecard `x/10` → `x*10`.
  - socket.dev category scores `0..1` → averaged → `*100`.
  - Snyk Advisor health score is already `/100`.
- A score maps to a level: `≥80 low`, `≥60 medium`, `≥40 high`, else `critical`.
- Advisory severities (`CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW`) map directly.
- The package's **overall** level is the worst real level across providers;
  `unknown` never raises the overall on its own.
- The `Build-vs-Buy` axis is **advisory**: its REIMPLEMENT?/CONSIDER/KEEP verdict
  is reported but excluded from the security `overall`.
